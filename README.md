Code snippets and other materials to help conduct email audit studies.

`sending_emails.r` contains code that researchers can use to automatially send emails to subjects. While researchers might still want to use this code, I'd recommend using [Yet Another Mail Merge](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/yet-another-mail-merge/mgmgmhkohaenhokbdnlpcljckbhpbmef?hl=en) instead. This recently available tool helps get around some of the sending limits and other issues associated with emailing recipients through 'non-secure' applications, like R.

`coding_replies.r` contains code that researchers can use to automatially code an email reply outcome from an email .mbox archive.

`crabtree2018.pdf` provides an introduction to conducting email audit studies. The citation for this piece is:

`audit_sudies_short_course.pdf` contains slides from a short course on email audit studies that I provided at the University of Michigan.
